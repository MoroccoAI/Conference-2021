## Title
### Natural language Processing For Moroccan Darija

## Description
The workshop will be divided into two parts: a tutorial where attendees will learn about Natural Language Processing (NLP) for a low resource language where attendees can analyze different Moroccan Darija datasets.

NLP is a field that is in high demand, and where research progresses actively and quickly. Whereas language technology for languages like English and French is highly developed, low-resource languages — like most African indigenous languages — have been marginalized. There are many opportunities to create new tools for languages with a few resources. In this workshop, we take the example of Moroccan Darija, Morocco’s national vernacular. We will present the latest tools, such as transformer-based models, to deal with Moroccan darija, we will also practice different NLP tasks to different Moroccan darija Datasets.

The participants will first learn basic NLP tools to analyze language. In the tutorial, we will go over NLP notions including text pre-processing and tokenization, n-gram language modeling, n-gram frequency and topic modeling. Then, we will introduce language models to perform different tasks such as text classification, dialect detection and sentiment analysis.The tutorial consists of theoretical definitions and concrete examples in Python.
